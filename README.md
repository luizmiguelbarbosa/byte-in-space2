## About the Project 🎮

**Byte in Space 2** is the sequel to *Byte in Space*, originally developed in Python using PyGame.

This version was completely rewritten in **C**, using the **Raylib** library, focusing on performance, modular architecture, and low-level system control.

Inspired by classic arcade games such as *Space Invaders*, the project represents a significant technical evolution, emphasizing structured code organization, memory management, and deeper understanding of game engine fundamentals.

## Build & Run ⚙️🛠️

This project uses **CMake** for cross-platform building.
