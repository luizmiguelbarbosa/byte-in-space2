## Description 🌌

**Byte in Space 2** is the evolution of the original Python-based project. Moving from Pygame to **C** and **Raylib**, this sequel offers a much more robust architecture, smoother performance, and advanced features like custom shaders and cross-platform compatibility. It stays true to the classic "Space Invaders" essence while pushing the technical limits of a second-period project.

## Folder Structure 📂

The project follows a modular C structure to keep source code, headers, and assets organized:

```bash
├── assets              # Game resources
│   ├── fonts           # Custom typography
│   ├── images          # UI elements and textures
│   │   └── sprites     # Game entities (Player, Enemies, VFX)
│   ├── ost             # Original Soundtrack and SFX
│   └── shaders         # GLSL Shaders for visual effects
│
├── external            # Platform-specific Raylib binaries
│   ├── raylib_linux
│   ├── raylib_macos
│   └── raylib_windows
│
├── include             # .h Header files
├── src                 # .c Source files
├── CMakeLists.txt      # Build configuration script
└── .idea               # IDE settings
```
## Libraries Used 📚
```bash
C Language 
Raylib 5.0

## Concepts Used
The transition from Python to C allowed the application of much more rigorous concepts. I moved from high-level abstractions to low-level control, utilizing **Manual Memory Management** and **Pointers** to optimize performance and resource handling.

The use of **Structs** was essential for organizing game data, acting as the foundation for the game's architecture. Additionally, I implemented **Custom Shaders (GLSL)** to enhance visual fidelity, providing effects that go beyond the standard drawing functions.

The project also applied **Linear Algebra** for movement and collision vectors, ensuring high precision in the game's physics loop, achieving a much more responsive feel compared to the first version.

## Challenges and Issues
The biggest challenge was the transition from the "managed" world of Python to the manual complexity of C. Managing memory without a garbage collector required a much more disciplined approach to avoid memory leaks and segmentation faults.

Another significant issue was ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Managing different Raylib binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows within the same repository required a solid understanding of how CMake links external dependencies. These technical hurdles provided a much steeper, yet more rewarding, learning curve than the first project, proving that good architecture is key to a stable game.
